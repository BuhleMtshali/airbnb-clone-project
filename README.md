🧠 Why Identifying Design Properties Matters
Identifying color styles, typography, and spacing in a Figma mockup is crucial for consistency and professional polish. Here's why:

🎯 Visual Consistency: Keeps your app looking clean and cohesive across every screen and device.

🧩 Component Reusability: You can build modular, scalable components when styles are standardized.

📱 Responsiveness: Helps you adjust fonts, colors, and layout for mobile-first design effortlessly.

🚀 Faster Development: With clear design rules, devs spend less time guessing and more time building.

🎨 Design-Dev Sync: Keeps designers and developers speaking the same visual language.

👥 Project Roles and Responsibilities
A successful project is built on collaboration. Each team member plays a specific role that ensures the product is well-planned, beautifully designed, solidly built, and seamlessly delivered. Here’s the breakdown:

| Role                       | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Collaboration: Smooth handoffs between design → frontend → backend → testing.

Accountability: Each deliverable has an owner, which helps keep the project moving.

Agility: With clearly defined roles, adapting to changes becomes second nature.

🧱 UI Component Patterns
In this section, we outline the core reusable components that will make up the Airbnb Clone’s user interface. Each component is designed with consistency, responsiveness, and scalability in mind — the building blocks of a clean, modern web app.

The reusable display unit for each property listing.

Features:

Featured image of the property

Property title and short description

Location and nightly price

Rating (stars) and number of reviews

Favorite (heart) icon

Company links (About, Careers, Help, etc.)

Social media icons

Legal disclaimers & terms

Copyright

Why it matters:
It provides essential site-wide information and gives the app a polished, professional finish.
